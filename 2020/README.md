# My Advent of Code 2020 Solutions

Open a clj file in emacs and use `cider-jack-in`.

Or, use `./scripts/repl.sh` to start a repl server, and then use
`cider-connect` to connect from emacs.

As of Day 15, I've solved them all except for: 

- Day 10 and 13 Part 1 solved. Code works but too slow for Part 2
- Day 14, Part 1 solved, but I haven't had time to try Part 2
